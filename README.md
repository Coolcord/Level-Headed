Level-Headed
============

Random Level Generator and Level Script Compiler for Super Mario Bros. 1 on the NES

-===========================- About Level-Headed -===========================-

 Level-Headed is an application that is still under development. Ultimately, I am
 designing it to be a random level generator that will work across multiple platforming
 games. In its current state, Level-Headed can essentially create new Mario games based
 off of Super Mario Bros. 1 (SMB1) with a click of a button! Users can also create their
 own levels using the "SMB1_Compliance" scripting language. As of now, only SMB1 is
 supported, but in the future, support for more games will be added.
 
 In order for Level-Headed to work properly, a base ROM must be supplied to Level-Headed.
 As of the Water Vapor Build (12/07/14), the following 5 ROMs are supported:
 
 Super Mario Bros. (JU) (PRG0) [!].nes
 
 Super Mario Bros. (JU) (PRG1).nes
 
 Super Mario Bros. (J).fds
 
 Super Mario Bros. + Duck Hunt (U).nes
 
 Super Mario Bros. + Duck Hunt + World Class Track Meet (U).nes
 
 
 Check out "Level-Headed Water Vapor Build Readme.pdf" under the "Doc" folder for more
 information on how to use the "Water Vapor" build of Level-Headed.
