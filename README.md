If you're interested in testing the next update of Level-Headed, you can join in and download the public beta update [here](https://github.com/Coolcord/Level-Headed/releases). Be prepared for bugs and unbalanced gameplay (yes, even more than usual!). As usual, feedback is appreciated and encouraged!

## About Level-Headed

 Level-Headed is an application that is still under development. Ultimately, I am
 designing it to be a random level generator that will work across multiple platforming
 games. In its current state, Level-Headed can essentially create new Mario games based
 off of Super Mario Bros. 1 (SMB1) with a click of a button! Users can also create their
 own levels using the "SMB1_Compliance" scripting language. As of now, only SMB1 is
 supported, but in the future, support for more games will be added.
 
 In order for Level-Headed to work properly, a base ROM must be supplied to Level-Headed.
 The following 2 ROMs are supported:
 * Super Mario Bros. (JU) (PRG0) [!].nes (MD5: 811B027EAF99C2DEF7B933C5208636DE)
 * Super Mario Bros. (JU) (PRG1).nes (MD5: 94EDE9347C1416105F1C08EC26B5B73A)
 
 Check out the [Level-Headed Wiki](https://github.com/Coolcord/Level-Headed/wiki) for more information and tutorials on how to use Level-Headed.
 
 If you're a Windows user, you can download the Windows build under the [releases](https://github.com/Coolcord/Level-Headed/releases) tab. Linux and Mac users should compile the application and plugins through QtCreator.

 ## FAQ
 
 **Q: I see that you have included graphics and music patches. Can you include mine in the next update?**
 
 A: Sure, I'll consider it! The graphics and music help make each game feel slightly more unique. Over time,
 I'd like to collect as many as I can to help add more variety.
 
 **Q: How do I add my own graphics and music patches?**
 
 A: There's a tutorial on how to do that on the wiki [here](https://github.com/Coolcord/Level-Headed/wiki/How-to-Add-Your-Own-Graphics-and-Music-Into-Level%E2%80%90Headed).
 
 **Q: What's going to be in the next update?**
 
 A: You can see what changes are going to be implemented by looking at the [changelog](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Coolcord/Level-Headed/master/Changelog.txt).
 
 **Q: What are you trying to work towards?**
 
 A: There are two major goals that I'm hoping to accomplish. The first is a pattern database for the 
 "SMB1_Compliance" generator. This should make it significantly easier to create new patterns and also
 allow users to create their own. The second goal is to add support for another game that isn't a
 Nintendo property.
 
 **Q: Is Level-Headed dead? You haven't updated it in months!**
 
 A: No, it is far from dead. I tend to work on Level-Headed off and on when I have spare time and when
 I have the interest. Consequently, development tends to be very slow and sporadic. However, I can't see
 myself ever dropping this project completely.
