Hammer Time! (v0.2.0) Built on 12/13/17
+ Hammer Time: When the level generator spawns an enemy, there is a 20% chance that it will be a hammer brother This tends to create unfair scenarios, so it is off by default. Turn it on to ramp up the difficulty!

+ Random Number of Levels per World: Castles are no longer always on the 4th level.
+ Improved RNG: Random numbers are now more uniform and more random. Seeds can now be specified and used.
+ God mode: An overpowered option just for fun. Be invincible. Jump in midair. Fireballs kill everything onscreen. You can basically fly when this is turned on.
+ Enemy Speeds (Normal, Fast, Speedy, Turbo, Ludicrous Speed!): Certain ground enemies will now move faster. Turbo and "Ludicrous Speed!" are disabled by default, but can be turned on for an extra challenge.
+ Hard Mode activator bytes are now set: Basically, Bowser now throws hammers in the later castle stages
+ Play as Luigi (patch by Yy): Luigi can now be selected before starting a game (replacing Player 2 option). This patch also includes lost levels physics. 2 Player games can still be generated as well (and this patch will not be applied when doing so).
