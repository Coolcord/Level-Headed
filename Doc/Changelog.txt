Hammer Time! (v0.2.0) Built on 12/13/17
+ Hammer Time: When the level generator spawns an enemy, there is a 20% chance that it will be a hammer brother This tends to create unfair scenarios, so it is off by default. Turn it on to ramp up the difficulty!
+ Move tables (pseudo-difficulty scaling): This is the largest feature of this update. Levels are now resized to accommodate the level generator. Early levels are shorter and have few enemies, while later levels are longer and have a higher enemy density ratio.
+ Random Number of Levels per World: Castles are no longer always on the 4th level.
+ Improved RNG: Random numbers are now more uniform and more random. Seeds can now be specified and used.
+ God mode: An overpowered option just for fun. Be invincible. Jump in midair. Fireballs kill everything onscreen. You can basically fly when this is turned on.
+ Enemy Speeds (Normal, Fast, Speedy, Turbo, Ludicrous Speed!): Certain ground enemies will now move faster. Turbo and "Ludicrous Speed!" are disabled by default, but can be turned on for an extra challenge.
+ Hard Mode activator bytes are now set: Basically, Bowser now throws hammers in the later castle stages
+ Play as Luigi (patch by Yy): Luigi can now be selected before starting a game (replacing Player 2 option). This patch also includes lost levels physics. 2 Player games can still be generated as well (and this patch will not be applied when doing so).
+ Set the number of starting lives: The default has been increased from 3 to 5, but it can be changed to anything from 1 to 99. You can also play with infinite lives.
+ Added an option to revert to Super Mario after taking damage (patch by w7m)
